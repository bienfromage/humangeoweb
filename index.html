  <h1 style = "text-align: center;">Human Geography in Websites</h1>
  <p>It’s been said that if your problem doesn’t involve geography, it’s not a problem. It is related to everything from what foods people eat to what languages they speak. So, it should not come as too big a surprise that human geography is inseparably intertwined with the modern internet. The standard conventions of the internet, such as windows, urls, etcetera, are all standardized as a result of various forms of cultural diffusion. Internet fads, from likes to memes, are controlled by human geography. Human geography has created the very standards by which websites to visit and which products to buy from online shopping websites. Because the internet is almost entirely an abstract object, it is appropriate to say that human geography shapes it.</p>
  <h1>Standard Internet Conventions</h1>
  <p>Much of the computer development of the 20th century, when the internet first began to gain popularity, was done in English speaking countries. Consequently, the programming languages used to create websites are largely English-based. For instance, if I were to create an alert box  with javascript, I would write “alert(“Hello, world.”);.” A Frenchman would write “alert(“Bonjour, le monde”);.” Though the content of the alert box changes, the code itself is still in English. This is not true for all programming languages. However, a significant number are English only.</p>
  <h1>Style</h1>
  <p>It’s fairly obvious that human popular culture shapes the content of the internet. Memes, likes, snaps, and even most modern slang was created by popular internet users and then, through the process of hierarchical diffusion, spread throughout the internet. The internet is also home to a considerable amount of folk culture. For example, there is a folk internet trend in which people use memes to mock Scranton’s economic decline in the past eighty years.</p>
